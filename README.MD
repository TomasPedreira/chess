# Chess
In this repo you'll find a complete (to my knowledge) implementation of the game of chess running on a http server with a web interface (not ui engineer pls dont judge it tm).

# How to run
In the root directory:
```cargo run```
Then open up http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser of choice.
Login in with your username and select the color you wish to play as.
Playing against ai ins't supported YET so you'll need another client do play properly.

# Notes
This is my first web/network project so the code may not be safe. Use at your own discretion.
